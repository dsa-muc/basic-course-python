Hello everyone,
We are very happy to have you join our first Python Beginner course next Saturday (May 15, 2021).

Before we start on Thursday everyone should have the following programs installed:
* **Python**
* **Anaconda**

If you don't have these two programs installed yet, that's no problem. Just watch this simple Youtube tutorial.
Tutorial (Windows):

Or just follow the Installation guide on the Anaconda Website itself:
https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

Please try to install these programs yourself before the course.

If you have any problems with the installation, don't worry, we will be at the meeting one hour before the course to help you.

### Daily schedule
09:00 - 10:00 Help with installation and bug fixes
10:00 - 12:30 Python Basics, Introduction to Numpy Package 
12:30 - 13-30 Lunch break

If you have any questions about the schedule or problems with the installation, feel free to contact us by mail (dsa-muc@fs.lmu.de) or just join our Slack Channel (https://dsa-muc.slack.com ) and let us know.

All the best

Niklas Walter and Max Lang
