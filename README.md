Hello everyone,
we are very happy to have you join our first Python Beginner course next Saturday (May 15, 2021).

Before we start on Thursday, everyone should have the following programs installed:
* **Python**
* **Anaconda**

If you don't have these two programs installed yet, that's no problem. Just watch this simple Youtube tutorial.
Tutorial (Windows):

Or just follow the Installation guide on the Anaconda Website itself:

**Please try to install these programs yourself before the course.**

If you have any problems with the installation, don't worry, we will be at the meeting one hour before the course to help you.

### Daily schedule
